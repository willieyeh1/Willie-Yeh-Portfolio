# Willie-s-Portfolio

The website is a portfolio of projects that I have done. The website has a navagation bar that will land you to the correct spot on the page. The body of the website is separated by 3 sections with my contact info below and the github link will take you to my github account. My code somehow got messed up so this is not my final version just something to turn in. I had the code ready, but do not have time to fix what happen to my code.
